			<p class='specialmargin'>Welcome to my site!  I'm Brian K.  I'm currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to develop my skills as a <b><em>full stack developer</em></b>, which I'm excited about.  I made this decision after parting ways with my former employer where I worked as a data analyst at a forensic accounting firm.  I currently tutor mathematics for students ranging from Middle School to College.  You can find a more detailed description of my tutoring services <a href="tutor.html"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
			<p class='horizontalmargin'>Before entering the working world, I had attended <a href='www.rutgers.edu'>Rutgers University</a>, where I achieved a Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics.  I honed my tutoring skills during this time by working part time at Kumon Learning Center, where I taught middle schoolers and high schoolers topics ranging from basic algebra through Calculus 2.</p>
			<p class='horizontalmargin'>I currently looking for new full time employment as a Full Stack Developer.  I believe my skills in mathematics, previous experience with OOP in Java and Python make a suitable candidate.  You can find a copy of my resume and related technical skills by request <a href='contacts.html'><u>here</u></a>.  A page of my web projects can be found <a href='portfolio.html'><u>here</u></a></p>
